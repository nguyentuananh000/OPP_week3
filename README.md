This project was a practical application of the object-oriented programming (OOP) principles we've studied. The process began with analyzing the core requirement: managing a fleet of vehicles. Following the theoretical model, the first step was to identify the central entity, which was clearly the "Vehicle." I abstracted the real-world concept of a vehicle into a class by identifying its essential characteristics (attributes like type and maxSpeed) and behaviors (methods like accelerate()).
The biggest challenge was translating this abstract model into a concrete C++ class structure. Deciding what should be private versus public was a key step that directly demonstrated the concept of encapsulation. By making the attributes private, I protected the data's integrity and controlled access through public getter methods. This design choice proved its value when extending the class later.
Creating objects like car, truck, and motorcycle from the Vehicle blueprint felt intuitive and powerful. It highlighted how a single class definition could be reused to represent multiple, distinct real-world objects. The most rewarding part was enhancing the class with a new attribute (engineType) and method (displayInfo()). Because of the encapsulated design, this extension was straightforward and didn't require major changes to the existing structure.
The exercise was a clear demonstration of how OOP helps in building modular, maintainable, and logical systems. It transforms a complex, real-world requirement into a manageable and scalable software solution by organizing code in a way that mirrors the real world.
